# Calculator

Need a calculator to help you out with mathematics? Look no further! This Calculator app will help you on your journey!


Motiovation was to learn and see how I can build a calculator!
I built this project to enhance my javascript skills and as well understand what I am doing.
The problems it solved were figuring out how to do a grid and actually build the app.
I learned about grids, calling functions, arrow functions, eventlisteners, keyboard functionality and much more.
